### Overview
PPG signals can often be noisy or malformed due to various factors, including motion artifacts or sensor placement issues. This repository provides an efficient solution to identify and exclude such erroneous waveforms, allowing for cleaner and more accurate data in downstream applications like heart rate monitoring or signal-based health assessments.

### Features
Automated detection of malformed PPG waveforms
Customizable thresholds and detection parameters
Easy integration with existing PPG processing workflows
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, clone this repository and install required packages:

'''bash
코드 복사
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PPG-Waveform-Validation.git
cd PPG-Waveform-Validation
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

### Usage
Here's an example of how to use the waveform validation code:

'''python
코드 복사
from ppg_waveform_validation import validate_waveform

# Load your PPG data
ppg_data = load_ppg_data("your_data_file.csv")

# Validate waveform
valid_waveforms = validate_waveform(ppg_data)

# Process only valid waveforms
process(valid_waveforms)
'''

### Parameters
Details on key parameters for validate_waveform:

threshold: Value to determine the sensitivity of the detection algorithm.
